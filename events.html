                                <h3>Photonics for New Generation Fully-Digital Radar and Wireless Communication Systems by Antonella Bogoni</h3>
                                <p>
                                  The speech will introduce the role of photonics for new generation radar and wireless communication systems. Modern techniques for the photonic-assisted RF generation will be detailed to provide extremely stable multicarrier signals up to the millimeter wave band, with an arbitrary amplitude and phase modulation and phase noise independent on the frequency.
                                  At the receiver photonic technologies will be reported for the optical sampling directly at RF and for the down-conversion of multiple heterogeneous RF signals, allowing an increased resolution.
                                  The innovative transceiver features guaranteed by the use of photonics, will be demonstrated for the development of new generation fully digital multiband single and array radar systems working at high frequency (X band and beyond), and for the design of radically new multi-protocol software- defined wideband wireless communication apparatus.
                                  Finally new applications for safety, traffic and environment control and for new mobile broadband services enabled by the photonic-based radar and wireless communication systems respectively will be summarized.                                </p>
